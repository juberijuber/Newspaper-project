                <p>The National Education Policy 2020 is a transformational policy advocating a complete reset of teaching and learning processes. Legacy education in India has focussed on developing a class of workers who are champions in cracking examinations and who are specialised in executing instructions given by a “competent” authority. It is quite apparent that the legacy education system was designed to deliver clerks and workers who are programmed to act on instructions given by those in power. </p>
                <p>The outcomes of our education system are myopic, and examination driven. Marks are more important than learning. The education sector continues to be dominated by “licence Raj” driven by multiple regulators and contradictory and convoluted regulations. The Central and State Universities are busy managing more colleges than they can handle and spend more time in organising exams and inspections instead of focussing on scholarship and learning outcomes</p>
               <p>There exists a large trust deficit between the industry and the academia and thus the employability of our graduates is lowThe “brain drain” of the 60’s, 70’s and the 80’s from India has contributed extensively towards scholarship and benefitted the developed world . </p>

                <p>The NEP 2020 is an expression of the intent of the Government to change all of the above and make a fresh start. The budget 2021 seems like a step in this direction. This is quite evident from some of the proposals made in this budget and they are setting up of 15,000 exemplar schools to show case the implementation of the NEP 2020 in action. This seems like an achievable target and this could set the stage for other schools to follow the established best practices, thereby translating the intent of NEP 2020 into action.</p>
                <p>The National Digital Educational Architecture (NDEAR) to support teaching and learning activities coupled with the National Initiative for School Heads and Teachers for Holistic Advancement (NISTHA) to train 56 lakh school teachers in 2021-22 digitally, will speed up the propagation of modern methods of teaching and enhanced assurance of learning.</p>
